So, sit back, relax, and let's get started!

## New Features

We're always looking to push the envelope, and this release is no exception. Let’s kick things off with a feature that has the potential to redefine how you create podcasts from your codebase: the **Playlist JSON Generation**. Here's what you need to know:

- We've introduced a new `playlist.go` module specifically designed to support playlist episodes. This feature seamlessly integrates into your podcast generation routine, producing a `playlist.json` file with every execution of the `generate` command—no extra flags needed anymore.
- Enhancements have been made to the `generateEpisodeSummary` function utilizing the OpenAI API, ensuring your podcasts not only highlight essential points but do so in a compelling way.
- To maintain the integrity of your podcast content, errors are now handled more gracefully. Even if some episodes face issues, they’re accounted for within the overall playlist.

Another exciting development is the introduction of the **Claude Code GitHub Actions Workflow**. This feature leverages AI to automate even more tasks within your codebase, helping streamline operations and boost productivity.

## Bug Fixes

Now, onto stability improvements. We’ve honed in on specific bugs to ensure a smoother, more reliable user experience:

- Significant improvements were made to `playlist_test.go`, with the addition of 8 comprehensive tests. These tests cover a variety of scenarios, from JSON marshaling and unmarshaling of playlist structures to dynamic system integration, ensuring robust playlist JSON handling and error-free operation.
- We’ve eliminated several redundancies to make the `generatePlaylistFile` function more adaptive, ensuring it creates necessary directory structures if they don't exist.

## Performance Improvements

No release would be complete without some thoughtful performance enhancements. Here’s how we’ve improved under the hood:

- Test coverage has expanded substantially, with rigorous integration and unit tests spanning our new command execution capabilities. These tests instill greater confidence in the reliability of our features.
- We've replaced hardcoded paths with constants across the board. This may seem like a subtle shift, but it significantly enhances codebase maintainability and readibility, setting the stage for future scalability and an improved developer experience.

## Breaking Changes

As with any powerful update, there are a few breaking changes to be mindful of:

- The `generate` command has been augmented to also coordinate dynamic command execution. This evolution could impact your pre-existing workflows or custom scripts. It’s important to review and update these scripts to integrate smoothly with these new functionalities.
