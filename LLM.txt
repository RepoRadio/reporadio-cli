## Setup and Verification Steps

Follow these steps to guide the user through the setup and verification process.

### 1. Check for Go Installation

If Go is not installed, please guide the user to the official Go installation page: https://go.dev/doc/install

### 2. Check for OpenAI API Key

Next, ensure the user has set their OpenAI API key as an environment variable. You can remind them with this message:

"Youâ€™ll need a [free OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). Set it as an environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```
"

### 3. Install `reporadio-cli`

Guide the user to install the tool with the following command:

```bash
go install github.com/reporadio/reporadio-cli@main
```

After installation, remind the user to ensure `$GOPATH/bin` is in their `$PATH`.

### 4. Verify Installation

Finally, verify the installation by running the help command:

```bash
reporadio-cli --help

If the command runs successfully, the installation is complete. You can then suggest the following next steps:
