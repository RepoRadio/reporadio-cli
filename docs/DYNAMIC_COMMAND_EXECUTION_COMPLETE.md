# Dynamic Command Execution Feature - Implementation Complete

## Summary

The dynamic command execution feature has been successfully implemented and tested! This feature allows users to include shell command output directly into their podcast episode generation.

## Key Accomplishments

### âœ… All Requirements Implemented

1. **Configuration Support**: Episodes can now include an optional `commands` field
2. **Sequential Execution**: Commands run sequentially from the project root directory  
3. **Output Capture**: Successfully captures stdout while excluding stderr
4. **Error Handling**: Failed commands are logged but don't stop execution
5. **Content Integration**: Command output is formatted and injected into LLM context
6. **Timeout Management**: Default 60s timeout with environment variable and CLI flag overrides

### âœ… New Functionality

- **Environment Variable**: `REPORADIO_COMMAND_TIMEOUT` (supports "30s", "2m", or "120" formats)
- **Command-Line Flag**: `--command-timeout` (same format support)
- **Robust Error Handling**: Continues execution even when individual commands fail
- **Clear Output Formatting**: Each command output has distinct headers for LLM context

### âœ… Comprehensive Testing

- 8 new test files created with full coverage
- Integration tests for end-to-end functionality  
- Timeout configuration testing
- Error handling validation
- Backward compatibility verified

## Example Usage

```yaml
# podcast.yml
episodes:
  - title: "Dynamic Content Demo"
    description: "Showcase of dynamic command execution"
    instructions: "Create engaging content with live data"
    voicing: "enthusiastic"
    include:
      - "README.md"
    commands:
      - "echo 'Welcome to the demo!'"
      - "date"
      - "git log --oneline -5"
      - "ls -la | head -10"
```

Command execution with custom timeout:
```bash
reporadio generate my-podcast --command-timeout 90s
```

Or via environment variable:
```bash
export REPORADIO_COMMAND_TIMEOUT=90
reporadio generate my-podcast
```

## Technical Implementation

The implementation follows TDD principles and integrates seamlessly with existing codebase:

- Commands execute in project root directory context
- Output is captured and formatted with clear headers
- Failed commands log errors but don't break the generation process
- Timeout defaults to 60 seconds with flexible override options
- All existing functionality remains unchanged (backward compatible)

The feature is now ready for production use! ðŸš€
